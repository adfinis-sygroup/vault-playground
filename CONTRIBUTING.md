## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if we merge in a pull request we look at the following
things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell us anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always
> look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells which problem you have found, and shows the action you have taken
to solve it.

### Does it include tests

Including tests for any new features or bugs is highly encouraged.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), we will
remove things that do not respect it.
